# lua54
 Script to download and build latest Lua 5.4 release,  
 mostly since the web with prebuilt binaries has only 5.4.2,  
 while the latest is 5.4.3

 You must have Visual Studio 2022 installed, preferrably in the default path.
 If you want to use cl.exe etc. that's in a different location, you must edit the script

# Usage
 Simply run the `build.ps1` file
